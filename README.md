# 🎯 Field of Miracles

A simple word-guessing game in Python inspired by the classic "Wheel of Fortune" style! Test your luck and memory by guessing the letters or the whole word within a limited number of attempts.

## 🕹️ How to Play

1. The program randomly selects a word from a predefined list.
2. You choose how many attempts you'd like to have.
3. Start guessing:
   - You can guess **one letter** at a time.
   - Or, try your luck and guess the **entire word**.
4. If you guess a correct letter, it will be revealed in the word.
5. The game ends when:
   - You correctly guess the full word.
   - You run out of attempts.

## 📦 Features
